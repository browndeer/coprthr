.SH NAME
clarg_set, clarg_set_global, clarg_set_local \- Set CL kernel arguments
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdcl.h>
.sp
.BI "void clarg_set( cl_kernel " krn ", unsigned int " argnum ", Tn " arg );
.sp
.BI "void clarg_set_global( cl_kernel " krn ", unsigned int " argnum ", void* " ptr );
.sp
.BI "void clarg_set_local( cl_kernel " krn ", unsigned int " argnum ", size_t " sizeb );
.SH DESCRIPTION
clarg_set(), clarg_set_global() and clarg_set_local() are used to set the
\fIargnum\fP argument of the CL kernel \fIkrn\fP prior to kernel execution.
.PP
clarg_set() is used for setting arguments of intrinsic type such as cl_int,
cl_float or cl_float4, etc.  For clarg_set() Tn can be any valid scalar or
vector type.
.PP
clarg_set_global is used for setting arguments of pointers to global memory
where \fIptr\fP points to memory that was allocated using a call to clmalloc()
and attached to the CL context of the target kernel.
.PP
clarg_set_local() is used for setting arguments of pointers to local memory
where \fIsizeb\fP indicates the size in bytes of the local memory that is
to be allocated.
